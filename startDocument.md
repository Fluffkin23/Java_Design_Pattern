## Problem Description
Imagine you are a software developer tasked with creating a simple music player application. This application will be used by people who want to listen to their favorite songs on their computer. 

The application should have the following features: 

*Song Selection*: Users should be able to browse their music library and select a song to play. They might have a large collection, so think about how to make this process user-friendly. 

*Playing Music*: Once a song is selected, users should be able to play the song. They should also have the option to pause the song if needed. 

*Volume Control*: Users should be able to adjust the volume of the music to their liking. They might want to listen to music softly in the background or blast their favorite song, so make sure the volume control is easy to use. 

*Creating Playlists*: Users should be able to create their own playlists. They might want to make a playlist for a party, a workout, or just their favorite songs. They should be able to add songs to the playlist and remove songs from the playlist. 

*Shuffling Songs*: Sometimes, users might want to mix things up. The application should have a feature that shuffles the songs in the playlist, playing them in a random order. 

*User Interface*: All of these features should be easy to use. The application should have a simple, intuitive user interface. Users should be able to easily find and use all of the features.

# Design Patterns Overview

Design patterns are standard solutions to common problems in software design. Each pattern is like a blueprint that you can customize to solve a particular design problem in your code. Here's an overview of some fundamental design patterns:

## Command Pattern

- **What it does:** Think of the Command pattern like using a remote control to operate your TV. Each button on the remote is a command that the TV can understand and execute, such as turning on/off, changing the channel, or adjusting the volume. In software, the Command pattern turns various actions (like play, pause, stop) into objects. This means you can control these actions more flexibly, such as scheduling them for later, undoing them, or logging them.
- **Problem it solves:** Without this pattern, every time you wanted to do something in the app, you'd have to directly tell it what to do right then and there. This can get messy, especially if you want to undo actions or keep track of what's been done. The Command pattern makes the app's actions more manageable and versatile.

## Factory Pattern (specifically PlaylistFactory)

- **What it does:** Imagine you're at a restaurant where you can customize your meal. You choose what you want (like pasta, pizza, or a salad), but you don't need to know how the kitchen makes it. The Factory pattern works similarly for creating playlists. You decide the type of playlist you want (like "Party" or "Workout"), and the Factory handles the creation details.
- **Problem it solves:** This pattern keeps you from needing to know all the technical details of how playlists are made. It makes the app easier to change and grow because you can add new playlist types without messing with the rest of your code.

## Decorator Pattern (specifically ShuffleDecorator)

- **What it does:** Imagine putting stickers on your laptop to customize it without buying a new one. The Decorator pattern lets you add new features to objects (like playlists) in a similar way. For example, you can add a "shuffle" feature to a playlist so the songs play in a random order, without changing how playlists are fundamentally made or used.
- **Problem it solves:** It's like getting a new feature without having to buy a new model. This pattern lets you add new tricks to your playlists without rewriting or complicating the original playlist code.

## Strategy Pattern (specifically SelectStrategy)

- **What it does:** Think of this like having different travel routes for getting to a destination depending on the time of day or traffic. The Strategy pattern allows you to choose different ways (or strategies) for doing something, like selecting the next song to play. You can switch strategies easily, like choosing between playing songs in order or randomly.
- **Problem it solves:** It gives you flexibility in how you do things, like choosing songs, without having to change the player's core. You can easily add new ways to select songs as you think of them.

## Observer Pattern

- **What it does:** It's like subscribing to a newsletter. Once you sign up, you automatically get updates whenever there's news. In the Observer pattern, parts of your app "subscribe" to changes in other parts. For example, if you add a new song to a playlist, the playlist view automatically updates to show this without you having to do anything extra.
- **Problem it solves:** Keeps different parts of your app in sync without them needing to constantly check in with each other. This way, when something changes (like adding a new song), all subscribed parts get updated automatically, making sure your app always shows the latest info.


## MVC Architecture Section:
- **`Model`**: 
    - Represents the application's data and business logic.
    - In this application, this includes classes like Song, Playlist, and MusicLibrary.
    - The Model is responsible for managing the data, logic, and rules of the application.
- **`View`**: 
    - Represents the UI components of the application.
    - Includes classes like MusicPlayerUI, PlaylistView, and LibraryView.
    - The View is responsible for displaying the data provided by the Model in a specific format.
- **`Controller`**: 
    - Acts as an interface between Model and View components.
    - Contains classes like MusicController that handle user input and convert it to commands for the Model or View.
    - The Controller interprets the input from the user, making calls to model objects to retrieve data or to view objects to display changes.

## Classes
- **`Song`** class: 
    - Represents an individual music track. 
    - Contains attributes like title, artist, and duration.
- **`Playlist`** class: 
    - Manages a collection of Song objects.
    - Allows operations like adding and removing songs, and accessing playlist details.
        - *Example*: "Workout Hits"

- **`MusicLibrary`** class: 
    - Stores and manages the entire collection of Song objects available in the application.
    - Facilitates song selection and browsing of the music library.
      
- **`MusicPlayerUI`** class: 
    - The main interface for user interaction.
    - Integrates features like playlist view and library view for user interaction.
         - *Example*: A graphical user interface with buttons for play, pause, and a slider for volume control.
           
- **`PlaylistView`** class and **`LibraryView`**: 
    - Dedicated views for displaying playlists and the music library respectively.
    - Handle user interactions specific to each view.
         - *Example*: PlaylistView shows a list of playlists, while LibraryView displays all available songs.
           
- **`MusicController`** class: 
    - Manages user interactions such as play, pause, and volume control.
    - Communicates with the model to update the state of the music player.
         - *Example*: Responds to a play button click by starting the selected song.
           
- **`Command`** (Design pattern) interface: 
    - Encapsulate different actions as executable commands.
    - Allow for flexible execution and potential undo functionalities.
         - *Example*: PlayCommand triggers the playing of a song when executed.
           
- **`PlaylistFactory`** (Design pattern) interface: 
    - Define the method for creating different types of playlists.
    - Allow for the easy addition of new playlist types.
         - *Example*:  PartyPlaylistFactory creates a playlist with upbeat, danceable tracks.
           
- **`ShuffleDecorator`** (Design pattern) class: 
    - Enhances a playlist with the capability to shuffle songs.
         - *Example*:  When applied to a playlist, the order of songs is randomized.
           
- **`SelectStrategy`** (Design pattern) interface: 
    - Define different strategies for song selection within a playlist.
         - *Example*:   RandomSelectionStrategy selects a song at random from a playlist.
           
- **`Observer`** (Design pattern) interface: 
    - Observe and respond to changes in the music library or playlists.
         - *Example*: PlaylistObserver updates the PlaylistView whenever a song is added or removed from a playlist.
           
- **`MusicPlayerApp`** class: 
    - The main class to initialize and integrate MVC components.
    - Acts as the entry point for the application.
         - *Example*:  Initializes the MusicLibrary, MusicPlayerUI, and MusicController on application startup.
