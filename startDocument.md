## Problem Description
Imagine you are a software developer tasked with creating a simple music player application. This application will be used by people who want to listen to their favorite songs on their computer. 

The application should have the following features: 

*Song Selection*: Users should be able to browse their music library and select a song to play. They might have a large collection, so think about how to make this process user-friendly. 

*Playing Music*: Once a playlist is selected, users should be able to play the Playlist. They should also have the option to pause the song if needed. 

*Volume Control*: Users should be able to adjust the volume of the music to their liking. They might want to listen to music softly in the background or blast their favorite song, so make sure the volume control is easy to use. 

*Creating Playlists*: Users should be able to create their own playlists. They might want to make a playlist for a party, a workout, or just their favorite songs. They should be able to add songs to the playlist and remove songs from the playlist. 

*Shuffling Songs*: Sometimes, users might want to mix things up. The application should have a feature that shuffles the songs in the playlist, playing them in a random order. 

*Repeat Song*: Sometimes, users might want to listen the same song over and over again.. The application should have a feature that let the user play a selected song again and again. 

*User Interface*: All of these features should be easy to use. The application should have a simple, intuitive user interface. Users should be able to easily find and use all of the features.

# Design Patterns Overview

Design patterns are standard solutions to common problems in software design. Each pattern is like a blueprint that you can customize to solve a particular design problem in your code. Here's an overview of some fundamental design patterns:

## Factory Pattern (specifically Song Creation)

- **What it does:** Imagine you're at a restaurant where you can customize your meal. You choose what you want (like pasta, pizza, or a salad), but you don't need to know how the kitchen makes it. The Factory pattern works similarly for creating a song. You decide the type of song you want (like "AIFF" or "WAV"), and the Factory handles the creation details.
- **Problem it solves:** This pattern keeps you from needing to know all the technical details of how a song is made. It makes the app easier to change and grow because you can add new song types(MP3, AAC, FLAC etc.) without messing with the rest of the code.


## Strategy Pattern (specifically Playback)

- **What it does:** Think of this like having different travel routes for getting to a destination depending on the time of day or traffic. The Strategy pattern allows you to choose different ways (or strategies) for doing something, like selecting the next song to play. You can switch strategies easily, like choosing between playing songs in order, randomly, or to play the same song, only on a button press.
- **Problem it solves:** It gives  flexibility in how you do things, like playing songs, without having to change the player's core. You can easily add new ways to play the songs from a playlist as you think of them.

## Observer Pattern

- **What it does:** It's like subscribing to a newsletter. Once you sign up, you automatically get updates whenever there's news. In the Observer pattern, parts of your app "subscribe" to changes in other parts. For example, if you add a new song to a playlist, the playlist view automatically updates to show this without you having to do anything extra / or sometimes you need to press a refresh a button.
- **Problem it solves:** Keeps different parts of the app in sync without them needing to constantly check in with each other. This way, when something changes (like adding a new song, creating a new playlist etc), all subscribed parts get updated automatically, making sure the app always shows the latest info.


## MVC Architecture Section:
- **`Model`**: 
    - Represents the application's data and business logic.
    - In this application, this includes classes like Song, Playlist, PlaylistLibrary and MusicLibrary.
    - `Also, all the classes from Factory Method folder (AIFFSong, AIFFSongCreator, SongCreator, WAVSong, WAVSongCreator). For a better view/ understading we decided to keep the Factory Method folder out from the Model.`
    - The Model is responsible for managing the data, logic, and rules of the application.
- **`View`**: 
    - Represents the UI components of the application.
    - Includes classes like MusicPlayerUI, PlaylistView, and LibraryView, CreateSongView.
    - The View is responsible for displaying the data provided by the Model in a specific format.
- **`Controller`**: 
    - Acts as an interface between Model and View components.
    - Contains classes like MusicController that handle user input and convert it to commands for the Model or View.
    - The Controller interprets the input from the user, making calls to model objects to retrieve data or to view objects to display changes.
